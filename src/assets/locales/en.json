During the transition I set up CI/CD for 50+ company repositories and wrote several custom actions to support preexisting workflow scenarios.\n- Author and maintainer of several Slack bots that enabled developers to deploy applications without ever leaving Slack and to painlessly book and use shared infrastructure and resources.

I also managed the technical debt and coordinated the communication with operations teams distributed over 4 countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the UK.\n<div>\n- Identified bottlenecks in internal service desk processes and proposed a solution to incorporate support responsibilities into product teams, instead of assigning a single member of the team to service desk duty each sprint. Implementing the proposition resulted in *increased operational efficiency*.\n- My team and I designed and created a service for automated collection and processing of bank statements. Clients are reminded to upload the documents, which are then processed by an <abbr title='Optical character recognition'>OCR</abbr> service to extract relevant data which is in turn sent over to a `camunda` process engine, and operations teams are alerted in case anything goes awry.</div>"

This project received a commendation from the CEO and I was offered to form a small product team of my own to evolve this project further.\n- Learned `react` the hard way: shortly after I joined the company my team was reassigned to another task and I was left behind to finish up the frontend for the customer account section of the website.

They were used throughout the main website and on a number of partner websites as a primary interface of placing orders with us by our customers, averaging *100k+ unique daily users*. We went through several major releases of the platform and gracefully shut down all outdated versions having migrated the platform customers.\n<div>\n- Trained a <abbr title='Machine Learning'>ML</abbr> model that showed 94% success rate in detecting intent of receiving tutoring services and classifying said services in user posts from social networks, scraped in real time.\n- Implemented a version of `damerau-levenshtein` algorithm that allowed assigning arbitrary weights to different operations.\n- Proudly designed and created an internal content management system that made use of business rules written in a custom <abbr title='domain-specific language'>DSL</abbr>. This introduced a shallower learning curve and helped cut personnel training time in half.\n- My team and I received a CEO’s Choice Award after ranking 4th in a corporate hackathon with a project for seamlessly converting customers into service providers.</details>"
